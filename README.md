## Why Lucid Memory?

**We're not a vector database. We're the retrieval layer that makes vector databases obsolete for AI memory.**

Pinecone stores vectors. We understand context.

### vs Pinecone ($750M+ valuation)

| | Lucid Memory | Pinecone |
|---|---|---|
| **Token efficiency** | 5x | 2.5x |
| **Recall** | 82.5% | 55.3% |
| **Latency** | 2.7ms | 10-50ms |
| **Monthly cost** | $0 | $70+ |
| **Your data** | Stays on your machine | Sent to cloud |
| **Recency awareness** | Yes (multiplicative) | No |
| **Associative retrieval** | Yes (spreading activation) | No |

Pinecone is a great vector database. But vector search isn't memory.

Lucid Memory retrieves **50% more relevant context** (82.5% vs 55.3% recall), runs **10-20x faster** (local vs cloud), costs **nothing**, and keeps your code **private**—all while understanding that what you accessed yesterday matters more than what you accessed last year.

---

### The Numbers

**5x more relevant context** per token than claude-mem. **2x more** than Pinecone. Same budget, 5x more useful memories.

**82.5% recall** vs 28.9% (claude-mem) and 55.3% (Pinecone) at equivalent token budgets. More of what you need surfaces.

**100% on adversarial recency tests**. Recent-but-irrelevant never beats old-but-relevant—unlike systems where recency overwhelms similarity.

<details>
<summary><b>Full benchmark data</b></summary>

**Realistic Developer Workflow Benchmarks:**

| Scenario | Lucid Memory | RAG Baseline | Delta |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Morning context restoration | 93.3% | 78.3% | +15.0% |
| Needle in haystack (200 memories) | 100% | 100% | — |
| Recency vs similarity tradeoff | 100% | 100% | — |
| Co-edited files (spreading activation) | 75% | 50% | +25.0% |
| Cold start (no history) | 100% | 100% | — |
| Adversarial recency trap | 100% | 100% | — |
| **Overall** | **94.7%** | **88.1%** | **+6.7%** |

*Note: RAG ties on adversarial tests because it ignores recency entirely. The test validates Lucid's recency handling doesn't break relevance—and it doesn't.*

**Token Efficiency (at 300 token budget):**

| Metric | Lucid Memory | Claude-mem | Pinecone RAG |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| Memories retrieved | 10-21 | 0-5 | 1-6 |
| Relevant memories found | 5-10 | 0-3 | 1-3 |
| Relative efficiency | **5x** | 1x | 2.5x |

**Speed (M-series Mac, 1024-dim embeddings):**

| Memories | Retrieval Time | Throughput |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 100      | 0.13ms         | 769k mem/s |
| 1,000    | 1.35ms         | 741k mem/s |
| 2,000    | 2.69ms         | 743k mem/s |
| 10,000   | ~13ms          | ~740k mem/s |

Spreading activation (depth 3) adds <0.1ms overhead.

</details>

### Why?

1. **Gist compression** — Memories stored as ~37 tokens, not ~75. 5x more fit in context.
2. **Cognitive ranking** — MINERVA 2 cubing (`sim³`) suppresses weak matches before budgeting.
3. **Multiplicative recency** — Relevance × recency, not relevance + recency. Irrelevant stays irrelevant.
4. **Spreading activation** — Related memories activate each other. Co-edited files surface together.
5. **No network** — Everything local. 2.7ms, not 200ms.
6. **Rust core** — 743,000 memories/second throughput

## Before & After

**Without Lucid:**
```
User: "Remember that bug we fixed in the auth module?"
Claude: "I don't have context from previous conversations..."
```

**With Lucid:**
```
User: "Remember that bug we fixed in the auth module?"
Claude: "Yes - the race condition in the session refresh. We fixed it
by adding a mutex around the token update. That was three weeks ago
when we were refactoring the middleware."
```

---

## Install in 60 Seconds

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL lucidmemory.dev/install | bash
```

<h4 id="windows">Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):</h4>

```powershell
irm lucidmemory.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

That's it. Your AI coding assistant now remembers across sessions.

<details>
<summary>What the installer does</summary>

1. Checks prerequisites (git, disk space)
2. Installs Bun runtime if needed
3. Sets up Ollama for local embeddings (or OpenAI API)
4. Lets you choose which clients to configure (Claude Code, Codex, or both)
5. Optionally configures database isolation (shared, per-client, or custom profiles)
6. Configures MCP settings for your chosen clients
7. Installs hooks for automatic memory capture
8. Restarts Claude Code to activate

**Requirements:** 5GB free disk space, Claude Code and/or Codex CLI installed

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multi-client configuration</b></summary>

Lucid Memory supports both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. During installation, you can choose:

**Database modes:**
- **Shared** (default) — All clients share the same memory database
- **Per-client** — Each client gets its own database (`memory-claude.db`, `memory-codex.db`)
- **Profiles** — Custom named databases for different contexts (e.g., work vs personal)

**Managing configuration:**
```bash
lucid config show                      # View current configuration
lucid config set-mode per-client       # Switch to per-client databases
lucid config create-profile work       # Create a new profile
lucid config set-profile codex work    # Assign Codex to use the work profile
```

**Environment variable:**

The `LUCID_CLIENT` environment variable determines which client is active. This is set automatically in the MCP config for each client.

## How It Works

Most AI memory is just vector search—embed query, find similar docs, paste into context.

Lucid implements how humans actually remember:

| Aspect | Traditional RAG | Lucid Memory |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| Model | Database lookup | Cognitive simulation |
| Memory | Static records | Living, evolving traces |
| Retrieval | Similarity search | Activation competition |
| Context | Ignored | Shapes what surfaces |
| Time | Flat | Recent/frequent = stronger |
| Associations | None | Memories activate each other |

**Want the full picture?** See [How It Works](HOW_IT_WORKS.md) for a deep dive into the cognitive architecture, retrieval algorithms, and neuroscience behind Lucid Memory.

<h3 id="visual-memory">Visual Memory</h3>

**New in 0.3:** Claude now sees and remembers images and videos you share.

When you share media in your conversation, Claude automatically processes and remembers it—not by storing the file, but by understanding and describing what it sees and hears. Later, when you mention something related, those visual memories surface naturally.

| Without Visual Memory | With Visual Memory |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| "What was in that screenshot?" | "That screenshot showed the error in the auth module—the stack trace pointed to line 47." |
| Claude forgets media between sessions | Visual memories persist and surface when relevant |
| Videos are just files | Claude remembers both what it saw AND what was said |

**How it works:**

- **Images** — Claude sees the image, describes it, and stores that understanding with semantic embeddings
- **Videos** — Rust parallel processing extracts frames and transcribes audio simultaneously; Claude synthesizes both into a holistic memory
- **Retrieval** — Visual memories are retrieved via the same cognitive model as text memories (ACT-R activation + semantic similarity)
- **Automatic** — No commands needed; share media, Claude remembers

<details>
<summary><b>Supported formats</b></summary>

**Images:** jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, heic, heif

**Videos:** mp4, mov, avi, mkv, webm, m4v

**URLs:** YouTube, Vimeo, youtu.be, direct media links

**Paths:** Simple paths, quoted paths with spaces, ~ expansion

</details>

<h3 id="location-intuitions">Procedural Memory</h3>

**New in 0.4.0:** Claude develops procedural memory—the "muscle memory" of coding.

After working in a project, Claude doesn't just remember files—it *knows* them. Like how you navigate your home without thinking, Claude builds instinctive knowledge of your codebase through repeated exposure.

| Without Procedural Memory | With Procedural Memory |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude searches for files every time | Claude navigates directly to familiar files |
| "Let me search for the auth handler..." | "I know auth is in `src/auth/handler.ts`" |
| Each session starts from zero | Familiarity persists and grows across sessions |
| No awareness of work patterns | Recognizes related files and workflows |

**How it works:**

- **Familiarity grows asymptotically** — First access: ~9% familiar. 10th access: ~50%. 24th access: 70%+ ("well-known"). Diminishing returns, like real learning.
- **Context is bound to location** — Claude remembers *what you were doing* when you touched each file (debugging? refactoring? reading?)
- **Session-aware associations** — Files accessed together in the same session get 1.5x stronger links
- **Workflow learning** — Files worked on for the same task form associative networks (3x boost)
- **Temporal retrieval** — Recent memories get priority through 4-phase cognitive processing:
  1. Working Memory buffer (τ≈4s decay, 7±2 item capacity)
  2. Session decay modulation (recent = slower forgetting)
  3. Project context boost (in-project memories ranked higher)
  4. Session tracking (30-min activity windows)
- **Graceful decay** — Unused files fade, but well-known ones have "sticky floors"—procedural knowledge resists forgetting

<details>
<summary><b>The neuroscience</b></summary>

Procedural Memory is modeled on five brain systems:

**Working Memory** (Baddeley, 2000; Cowan, 2001)
- Short-term buffer with ~7 items and ~4 second decay
- Recently retrieved memories get 2x activation boost
- Implements the "tip of the tongue" phenomenon

**Hippocampal Place Cells** (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978)
- Neurons that fire when you're in a specific location
- Familiarity increases with repeated exposure
- Our implementation: `familiarity = 1 - 1/(1 + 0.1n)` where n = access count

**Entorhinal Cortex** (Moser et al., 2008)
- Binds context to spatial memory — *where* + *what you were doing*
- We track activity type (reading, writing, debugging) bound to each file access

**Procedural Memory** (Squire, 1992)
- "Knowing how" vs "knowing that" — you don't consciously recall how to ride a bike
- Direct file access (without searching) indicates procedural knowledge
- We track `searchesSaved` as a signal of true familiarity

**Associative Networks** (Hebb, 1949)
- "Neurons that fire together wire together"
- Files accessed for the same task form bidirectional associations
- Session-based boost (1.5x) for files accessed in the same work session

</details>

### The Science

Built on two foundational cognitive models:

**ACT-R** (Anderson, 1983) — Memories compete for retrieval based on activation:
- Base-level activation from recency and frequency
- Spreading activation through associations
- Retrieval probability from activation strength

**MINERVA 2** (Hintzman, 1988) — Reconstructive retrieval:
- Probe-trace similarity with nonlinear activation (cubing)
- Strong matches dominate, weak matches contribute minimally
- Pattern completion from partial cues

<details>
<summary><b>Technical details</b></summary>

### Three Sources of Activation

Every memory's retrieval probability comes from:

**1. Base-Level (Recency & Frequency)**
```
B(m) = ln[Σ(t_k)^(-d)]
```
Recent and frequent access = higher activation.

**2. Probe-Trace Similarity**
```
A(i) = S(i)³
```
MINERVA 2's cubic function emphasizes strong matches.

**3. Spreading Activation**
```
A_j = Σ(W_i / n_i) × S_ij
```
Activation flows through the association graph.

### The Pipeline

1. Compute similarities between probe and all traces
2. Apply nonlinear activation (cubing)
3. Compute base-level from access history
4. Spread activation through associations
5. Combine, rank, and filter by probability

## For Developers

Want to embed the retrieval engine in your own project?

```rust
use lucid_core::{
    retrieval::{retrieve, RetrievalConfig, RetrievalInput},
    spreading::Association,
};

let input = RetrievalInput {
    probe_embedding: &probe,
    memory_embeddings: &memories,
    access_histories_ms: &histories,
    emotional_weights: &weights,
    decay_rates: &decays,
    associations: &[],
    current_time_ms: now,
};

let results = retrieve(&input, &RetrievalConfig::default());
```

<details>
<summary><b>Full API example</b></summary>

```rust
use lucid_core::{
    retrieval::{retrieve, RetrievalConfig, RetrievalInput},
    spreading::Association,
};

// Your memory embeddings (from any embedding model)
let memories = vec![
    vec![1.0, 0.0, 0.0],  // Memory 0
    vec![0.5, 0.5, 0.0],  // Memory 1
    vec![0.0, 1.0, 0.0],  // Memory 2
];

// What you're looking for
let probe = vec![0.9, 0.1, 0.0];

let input = RetrievalInput {
    probe_embedding: &probe,
    memory_embeddings: &memories,
    access_histories_ms: &[vec![1000.0], vec![500.0], vec![100.0]],
    emotional_weights: &[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    decay_rates: &[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    associations: &[],
    current_time_ms: 2000.0,
};

let config = RetrievalConfig::default();
let results = retrieve(&input, &config);

for candidate in results {
    println!(
        "Memory {} - activation: {:.3}, probability: {:.3}",
        candidate.index,
        candidate.total_activation,
        candidate.probability
    );
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration options</b></summary>

```rust
let config = RetrievalConfig {
    decay_rate: 0.5,           // Base-level decay (0.5 = human-like)
    activation_threshold: 0.3,  // Retrieval threshold
    noise_parameter: 0.1,       // Randomness (higher = more random)
    spreading_depth: 3,         // Association traversal depth
    spreading_decay: 0.7,       // Decay per hop
    min_probability: 0.1,       // Filter threshold
    max_results: 10,            // Result limit
    bidirectional: true,        // Spread both directions
};
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Associations</b></summary>

Link memories to enable spreading activation:

```rust
use lucid_core::spreading::Association;

let associations = vec![
    Association {
        source: 0,
        target: 1,
        forward_strength: 0.8,   // Source → Target
        backward_strength: 0.3,  // Target → Source
    },
];
```

When memory 0 activates, memory 1 receives proportional activation.
