//! Spreading Activation Example
//!
//! This example demonstrates how memories activate related memories
//! through the association graph. When you think of "coffee," related
//! memories (morning routine, that café, the conversation) get activated too.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --example spreading_activation`
